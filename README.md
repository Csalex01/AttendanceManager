# ðŸ“Š AttendanceManager

## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Most teachers have experienced that tracking the attendance of students can be tedious and difficult during, or after the class. This opens up several problems. On one hand, it can take a lot of time, on the other hand, it is up to the honesty of students when it comes to signing their name on a piece of paper. This can be an unpleasant experierience for everyone.

Our project tries to eliminate the aforementioned problem with this web application. This tool can be used by both students and teachers. The application is easy to use. A class specific QR code can be generated by the teacher and it is scanned by the students. After that, they get redirected to the website and register their presence.

In today's world, it is almost impossible to imagine our everyday lives without our phones, mostly smartphones. A QR code is a great soltuion to this problem because it is fast and requires little to no effort to scan it. Almost all smartphones have a built-in QR code scanner, which makes the idea behind this software work.

## âš½ Goals

When developing this project, the following goals were formulated:

- facilitate the daily dasks of teachers and students;
- attendance should also be monitored in a virtual environment;
- finding a faster and more efficient way to track presence in class;
- simple and clear user interface (UI);
- simple interaction between the user and the application.
